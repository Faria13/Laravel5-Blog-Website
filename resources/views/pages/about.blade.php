        been working for two years in this club. We had organized two national 
        events where at least 1500 young children were perticipated. It was a great
        experience for me. Now I am a member of Lumainery club which is working for
        penniless young children where they are indoctrinated. I love to read book 
        and feel great to spend time with children. I enjoy taking complex problems 
        and turning them into simple and beautiful interface designs. I also love
